# Abstract
Tremendous progress has been made in deep stereo matching to excel on benchmark datasets through per-domain fine-tuning. However, achieving strong zero-shot generalization ‚Äî a hallmark of foundation models in other computer vision tasks ‚Äî remains challenging for stereo matching. We introduce FoundationStereo, a foundation model for stereo depth estimation designed to achieve strong zero-shot generalization. To this end, we first construct a large-scale (1M stereo pairs) synthetic training dataset featuring large diversity and high photorealism, followed by an automatic self-curation pipeline to remove ambiguous samples. We then design a number of network architecture components to enhance scalability, including a side-tuning feature backbone that adapts rich monocular priors from vision foundation models to mitigate the sim-to-real gap, and long-range context reasoning for effective cost volume filtering. Together, these components lead to strong robustness and accuracy across domains, establishing a new standard in zero-shot stereo depth estimation.

**TLDR**: Our method takes as input a pair of stereo images and outputs a dense disparity map, which can be converted to a metric-scale depth map or 3D point cloud.

# Installation
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate foundation_stereo
```

# Model Weights
- Download the foundation model for zero-shot inference on your data from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VhPebc_mMxWKccrv7pdQLTvXYVcLYpsf?usp=sharing). Put the entire folder (e.g. `23-51-11`) under `./pretrained_models/`.


# Run demo
```
python scripts/run_demo.py --left_file ./assets/left.png --right_file ./assets/right.png --ckpt_dir ./pretrained_models/model_best_bp2.pth --out_dir ./test_outputs/
```
You can see output point cloud.

Tips:
- The input left and right images should be **rectified and undistorted**, which means there should not be fisheye kind of lens distortion and the epipolar lines are horizontal between the left/right images. If you obtain images from stereo cameras such as Zed, they usually have [handled this](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-sdk/blob/3472a79fc635a9cee048e9c3e960cc48348415f0/recording/export/svo/python/svo_export.py#L124) for you.
- We recommend to use PNG files with no lossy compression
- Our method works best on stereo RGB images. However, we have also tested it on gray scale images or IR images and it works well too.
- For all options and instructions, check by `python scripts/run_demo.py --help`
- For high-resolution image (>1000px), you can run with `--hiera 1` to enable hierarchical inference for better performance.
- For faster inference, you can reduce the input image resolution by e.g. `--scale 0.5`, and reduce refine iterations by e.g. `--valid_iters 16`.


# FAQ
- Q: My GPU doesn't support Flash attention?<br>
  A: See [this](https://github.com/NVlabs/FoundationStereo/issues/13#issuecomment-2708791825).

- Q: RuntimeError: cuDNN error: CUDNN_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED. This error may appear if you passed in a non-contiguous input.<br>
  A: This may indicate OOM issue. Try reducing your image resolution or use a GPU with more memory.


# FSD Dataset
Coming soon by the end of March. Stay tuned!
